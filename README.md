STD Guidelines iPhone prototype, Version 2 
===========
The goal of this prototype has been to collaborate with CDC's STD team to design a mobile app for the iPhone containing the 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines. This prototype, v2, builds on the first prototype version to have more of a "portal" feel. The application is to serve as a reference for doctors and related parties on the identification of and treatment regimen for STDs.

Prototype write-up is available through [PHIResearchLab.org](http://phiresearchlab.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97:shirly-app&catid=1:prototypes&Itemid=3)
