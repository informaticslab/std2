  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Cervicitis</h2>

  <p>Two major diagnostic signs characterize cervicitis: 1) a purulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or on an endocervical swab specimen (commonly referred to as mucopurulent cervicitis or cervicitis) and 2) sustained endocervical bleeding easily induced by gentle passage of a cotton swab through the cervical os. Either or both signs might be present. Cervicitis frequently is asymptomatic, but some women complain of an abnormal vaginal discharge and intermenstrual vaginal bleeding (e.g., after sexual intercourse). A finding of leukorrhea (&gt;10 WBC per high-power field on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid) has been associated with chlamydial and gonococcal infection of the cervix. In the absence of inflammatory vaginitis, leukorrhea might be a sensitive indicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative predictive value (257,258). Although some specialists consider an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on endocervical Gram stain as being useful in the diagnosis of cervicitis, this criterion has not been standardized. In addition, it has a low positive-predictive value (PPV) for&nbsp;infection with <i>C. trachomatis</i> and <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and is not available in most clinical settings. Finally, although the presence of GNID on Gram stain of endocervical fluid is specific for the diagnosis of gonococcal cervical infection, it is not a sensitive indicator, because it is observed in only 50% of women with this infection.</p>

  <p>Etiology</p>

  <p>When an etiologic organism is isolated in the presence of cervicitis, it is typically <i>C. trachomatis</i> or <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. Cervicitis also can accompany trichomoniasis and genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection). However, in most cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially in women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STDs (e.g., women aged &gt;30 years). Limited data indicate that infection with <i>M. genitalium</i> and BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis (259–263). For reasons that are unclear, cervicitis can persist despite repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy. Because most persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by relapse or reinfection with <i>C. trachomatis</i> or <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, other factors (e.g., persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, douching [or exposure to other types of chemical irritants], or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy) might be involved.</p>

  <p>Diagnosis</p>

  <p>Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper-genital–tract infection (endometritis), women who seek medical treatment for a new episode of cervicitis should be assessed for signs of PID and should be tested for <i>C. trachomatis</i> and for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> with the most sensitive and specific test available. Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for the presence of BV and trichomoniasis, and if these organisms are detected, they should be treated. Because the sensitivity of microscopy to detect <i>T. vaginalis</i> is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., culture or other FDA-cleared method). Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e., culture or serologic testing) for HSV-2 in this setting is unknown. Standardized diagnostic tests for <i>M. genitalium</i> are not commercially available.</p>

  <p>As discussed, NAAT should be used for diagnosing <i>C. trachomatis</i> and <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> in women with cervicitis; this testing can be performed on either vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (197). A finding of &gt;10 WBC in vaginal fluid, in the absence of trichomoniasis, might indicate endocervical inflammation caused specifically by <i>C. trachomatis</i> or <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> (264,265).</p>

  <p>Treatment</p>

  <p>Several factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis or to await the results of diagnostic tests. Treatment with antibiotics for <i>C. trachomatis</i> should be provided for those women at increased risk for this common STD (e.g., those aged ≤25 years, those with new or multiple sex partners, and those who engage in unprotected sex), especially if follow-up cannot be ensured and if a relatively insensitive diagnostic test is used in place of NAAT. Concurrent therapy for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> is indicated if the prevalence of this infection is &gt;5% (those in younger age groups and those living in certain facilities).</p>

  <p>Trichomoniasis and BV should also be treated if detected. For women in whom any component of (or all) presumptive therapy is deferred, the results of sensitive tests for <i>C. trachomatis</i> and <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> (e.g., NAATs) should determine the need for treatment subsequent to the initial evaluation.</p>

  <p>Recurrent and Persistent Cervicitis</p>

  <p>Women with persistent cervicitis should be reevaluated for possible reexposure to an STD. If relapse and/or reinfection with a specific STD has been excluded, BV is not present, and sex partners have been evaluated and treated, management options for persistent cervicitis are undefined; in addition, the utility of repeated or prolonged administration of antibiotic therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis remains unknown. Women who receive such therapy should return after treatment so that a determination can be made regarding whether cervicitis has resolved. Research is needed on the etiology of persistent cervicitis including the potential role of M. genitalium (266). In women with persistent symptoms that are clearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic specialist can be considered.</p>

  <p>Follow-Up</p>

  <p>Follow-up should be conducted as recommended for the infections for which a woman is treated. If symptoms persist, women should be instructed to return for re-evaluation because women with documented chlamydial or gonococcal infections have a high rate of reinfection within 6 months after treatment. Therefore, repeat testing of all women with chlamydia or&nbsp;gonorrhea is recommended 3-6 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (267).</p>

  <p>Management of Sex Partners</p>

  <p>Management of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis should be appropriate for the identified or suspected STD. Partners should be notified and examined if chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified or suspected in the index patient; these partners should then be treated for the STDs for which the index patient received treatment. To avoid reinfection, patients and their sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is completed (i.e., 7 days after a single-dose regimen or after completion of a 7-day regimen). Expedited partner treatment and patient referral (see Partner Management) are alternative approaches to treating male partners of women that have chlamydia or gonococcal infections (68,69,71).</p>

  <p>Special Considerations: &nbsp;HIV Infection</p>

  <p>Patients who have cervicitis and also are infected with HIV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who are HIV negative. Treatment of cervicitis in HIV-infected women is vital because cervicitis increases cervical HIV shedding. Treatment of cervicitis in HIV-infected women reduces HIV shedding from the cervix and might reduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners (268–270).</p>
