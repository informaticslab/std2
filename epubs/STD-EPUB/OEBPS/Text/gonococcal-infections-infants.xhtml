  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Gonococcal Infections Among Infants</h2>

  <p>Gonococcal infection among infants usually is caused by exposure to infected cervical exudate at birth. It is usually an acute illness that manifests 2–5 days after birth. The prevalence&nbsp;of infection among infants depends on the prevalence of infection among pregnant women, whether pregnant women are screened for gonorrhea, and whether newborns receive ophthalmia prophylaxis. The most severe manifestations of N. gonorrhoeae infection in newborns are ophthalmia neonatorumand sepsis, which can include arthritis and meningitis. Less severe manifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, and reinfection at sites of fetal monitoring.</p>

  <p>Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by N. gonorrhoeae</p>

  <p>Although N. gonorrhoeae causes ophthalmia neonatorum relatively infrequently in the United States, identifying and treating this infection is especially important because ophthalmia&nbsp;neonatorum can result in perforation of the globe of the eye and blindness.</p>

  <p>Diagnostic Considerations</p>

  <p>Infants at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia are those who do not receive ophthalmia prophylaxis and those whose mothers have had no prenatal care or whose mothers have a history of STDs or substance abuse. Gonococcal ophthalmia&nbsp;is strongly suspected when intracellular gram-negative diplococci are identified in conjunctival exudate, justifying presumptive treatment for gonorrhea after appropriate cultures for N. gonorrhoeae are obtained. Appropriate chlamydial testing&nbsp;should be done simultaneously. Presumptive treatment for N. gonorrhoeae might be indicated for newborns who are at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia and who have increased WBCs (but not gonococci) in a Gram-stained smear of conjunctival exudate.</p>

  <p>In all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis, conjunctival exudates should be cultured for N. gonorrhoeae and tested for antibiotic susceptibility before a definitive diagnosis is made. A definitive&nbsp;diagnosis is vital because of the public health and social consequences of a diagnosis of gonorrhea. Nongonococcal causes of neonatal ophthalmia include Moraxella catarrhalis and other Neisseria species, organisms that are indistinguishable&nbsp;from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram-stained smear but can be differentiated in the microbiology laboratory.</p>

  <p>Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate and is unnecessary&nbsp;if systemic treatment is administered.</p>

  <p>Other Management Considerations<br /></p>

  <p>Simultaneous infection with C. trachomatis should be considered when a patient does not improve after treatment. Both mother and infant should be tested for chlamydial infectionat the same time that gonorrhea testing is conducted (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis). Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to hyperbilirubinemic&nbsp;infants, especially those born prematurely.</p>

  <p>Follow-Up</p>

  <p>Infants who have gonococcal ophthalmia should be hospitalized&nbsp;and evaluated for signs of disseminated infection (e.g., sepsis, arthritis, and meningitis). One dose of ceftriaxone is adequate therapy for gonococcal conjunctivitis.</p>

  <p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners</p>

  <p>The mothers of infants who have gonococcal infection and the mothers’ sex partners should be evaluated and treated&nbsp;according to the recommendations for treating gonococcal infections in adults (see Gonococcal Infections in Adolescents and Adults).</p>

  <p>DGI and Gonococcal Scalp Abscesses in Newborns</p>

  <p>Sepsis, arthritis, and meningitis (or any combination of these conditions) are rare complications of neonatal gonococcal infection. Localized gonococcal infection of the scalp can result from fetal monitoring through scalp electrodes. Detection of gonococcal infection in neonates who have sepsis, arthritis, meningitis, or scalp abscesses requires cultures of blood, CSF, and joint aspirate on chocolate agar. Specimens obtained from the conjunctiva, vagina, oropharynx, and rectum that are cultured&nbsp;on gonococcal selective medium are useful for identifying the primary site(s) of infection, especially if inflammation is present. Positive Gram-stained smears of exudate, CSF, or joint aspirate provide a presumptive basis for initiating treatment for N. gonorrhoeae. Diagnoses based on Gram-stained smears or presumptive identification of cultures should be confirmed with definitive tests on culture isolates.</p>

  <p>Prophylactic Treatment for Infants Whose Mothers Have Gonococcal Infection</p>

  <p>Infants born to mothers who have untreated gonorrhea are at high risk for infection.</p>

  <p>Other Management Considerations</p>

  <p>Both mother and infant should be tested for chlamydial infection.</p>

  <p>Follow-Up</p>

  <p>Follow-up examination is not required.</p>

  <p>Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners</p>

  <p>The mothers of infants who have gonococcal infection and the mothers’ sex partners should be evaluated and treated according to the recommendations for treatment of gonococcal infections in adults (see Gonococcal Infections).</p>
