  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Reporting and Confidentiality</h2>

  <p>The accurate and timely reporting of STDs is integral to efforts to assess morbidity trends, allocate limited resources, and assist local health authorities in partner notification and treat- ment. STD/HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases should be reported in accordance with state and local statutory requirements. Syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, HIV infection, and AIDS are reportable diseases in every state. Because the requirements for reporting other STDs differ by state, clinicians should be familiar with the reporting requirements applicable within their jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>Reporting can be provider- or laboratory-based. Clinicians who are unsure of state and local reporting requirements should seek advice from state or local health departments or STD programs. STDs and HIV reports are kept strictly confidential. In most jurisdictions, such reports are protected by statute from subpoena. Before conducting a follow-up of a positive STD-test result, public health professionals should consult the patientâ€™s health-care provider to verify the diagnosis and to determine the treatments being received.</p>
