  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Lymphogranuloma Venereum</h2>

  <p>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovars L1, L2, or L3 (194). The most common clinical manifestation of LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited genital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. However, by the time patients seek care, the lesions have often disappeared. Rectal exposure in women or MSM can result in proctocolitis, including mucoid and/or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, and/or tenesmus (195,196). LGV is an invasive, systemic infection, and if it is not treated early, LGV proctocolitis can lead to chronic, colorectal fistulas and strictures. Genital and colorectal LGV lesions can also develop secondary bacterial infection or can be coinfected with other sexually and nonsexually transmitted pathogens.</p>

  <p>Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and the exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or genital or rectal ulcers. <i>C. trachomatis</i> testing also should be conducted, if available.</p>

  <p>Genital and lymph node specimens (i.e., lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested for C. trachomatis by culture, direct immunofluorescence, or nucleic acid detection. NAATs for <i>C. trachomatis</i> are not FDA-cleared for testing rectal specimens, although some laboratories have performed the CLIA validation studies that are needed to provide results for clinical management. Additional molecular procedures (e.g., PCR-based genotyping) can be used to differentiate LGV from non-LGV C. trachomatis, but these are not widely available.</p>

  <p>Chlamydia serology (complement fixation titers &gt;1:64) can support the diagnosis of LGV in the appropriate clinical context. Comparative data between types of serologic tests are lacking, and the diagnostic utility of serologic methods other than complement fixation and some microimmunofluorescence procedures has not been established. Serologic test interpretation for LGV is not standardized, tests have not been validated for clinical proctitis presentations, and <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovar-specific serologic tests are not widely available.</p>

  <p>In the absence of specific LGV diagnostic testing, patients with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV, including proctocolitis or genital ulcer disease with lymphadenopathy, should be treated for LGV as described in this report.</p>

  <p>Treatment</p>

  <p>Treatment cures infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage, although tissue reaction to the infection can result in&nbsp;scarring. Buboes might require aspiration through intact skin or incision and drainage to prevent the formation of inguinal/ femoral ulcerations. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment.</p>

  <p>Although clinical data are lacking, azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks is probably effective based on its chlamydial antimicrobial activity. Fluoroquinolone-based treatments might also be effective, but extended treatment intervals are likely required.</p>

  <p>Follow-Up</p>

  <p>Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved.</p>

  <p>Management of Sex Partners</p>

  <p>Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patientâ€™s symptoms should be examined, tested for urethral or cervical chlamydial infection, and treated with a chlamydia regimen (azithromycin 1 gm orally single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days).</p>

  <p>Special Considerations&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Pregnancy</p>

  <p>Pregnant and lactating women should be treated with erythromycin. Azithromycin might prove useful for treatment of LGV in pregnancy, but no published data are available regarding its safety and efficacy. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnant women.</p>

  <p>HIV Infection</p>

  <p>Persons with both LGV and HIV infection should receive the same regimens as those who are HIV negative. Prolonged therapy might be required, and delay in resolution of symptoms might occur.</p>
