  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Gonococcal Infections Among Children</h2>

  <p>Sexual abuse is the most frequent cause of gonococcal infection in preadolescent children (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). For preadolescent girls, vaginitis is the most common manifestation of this infection; gonococcal-associated PID after vaginal infection is likely less common in preadolescents than adults. Among sexually abused children, anorectal and pharyngeal infections with N. gonorrhoeae are common and frequently asymptomatic.</p>

  <p>Diagnostic Considerations</p>

  <p>Because of the legal implications of a diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection in a child, culture remains the preferred</p>

  <p>method for diagnosis. Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exlude gonorrhea. NAATs for the detection</p>

  <p>of N. gonorrhoeae can be used under certain circumstances (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children)</p>

  <p>Follow-Up<br /></p>

  <p>Follow-up cultures are unnecessary if ceftriaxone is used.</p>

  <p>Other Management Considerations</p>

  <p>Only parenteral cephalosporins (i.e., ceftriaxone) are recommended&nbsp;for use in children; cefotaxime is approved for gonococcal&nbsp;ophthalmia only. No data are available regarding the use of oral cefixime to treat gonococcal infections in children.</p>

  <p>All children found to have gonococcal infections should be evaluated for coinfection with syphilis and C. trachomatis. (For a discussion of concerns regarding sexual assault, see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children.)</p>

  <p>Ophthalmia Neonatorum Prophylaxis</p>

  <p>To prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, a prophylactic&nbsp;agent should be instilled into the eyes of all newborn infants; this procedure is required by law in most states. All of the recommended prophylactic regimens in this section prevent gonococcal ophthalmia. However, the efficacy of these preparations in preventing chlamydial ophthalmia is less clear, and they do not eliminate nasopharyngeal colonization by C. trachomatis. The diagnosis and treatment of gonococcal and chlamydial infections in pregnant women is the best method for preventing neonatal gonococcal and chlamydial disease. Not all women, however, receive prenatal care, and therefore go untreated. Ocular prophylaxis is warranted for neonates, because it can prevent sight-threatening gonococcal ophthalmia and because it is safe, easy to administer, and inexpensive.</p>

  <p>This preparation should be instilled into both eyes of every neonate as soon as possible after delivery. Ideally, ointment should be applied using single-use tubes or ampules rather than multiple-use tubes. If prophylaxis is delayed (i.e., not administered&nbsp;in the delivery room), a monitoring system should be established to ensure that all infants receive prophylaxis. All infants should be administered ocular prophylaxis, regardless of whether they are delivered vaginally or by cesarean section.</p>

  <p>Erythromycin is the only antibiotic ointment recommended for use in neonates. Silver nitrate and tetracycline ophthalmic ointment are no longer manufactured in the United States, bacitracin&nbsp;is not effective, and povidone iodine has not been studied adequately. If erythromycin ointment is not available, infants at risk for exposure to N. gonorrhoeae (especially those born to a mother with untreated gonococcal infection or who has received no prenatal care) can be administered ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg IV or IM, not to exceed 125 mg in a single dose.</p>
