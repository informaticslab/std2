  <h2 id="heading_id_3">Urethritis</h2>

  <p>Urethritis, as characterized by urethral inflammation, can result from infectious and noninfectious conditions. Symptoms, if present, include discharge of mucopurulent or purulent material, dysuria, or urethral pruritis. Asymptomatic infections are common. Although <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and <i>C. trachomatis</i> are well established as clinically important infectious causes of urethritis, Mycoplasma genitalium has also been associated with urethritis (240–243). If clinic-based diagnostic tools (e.g., Gram-stain microscopy, first void urine with microscopy, and leukocyte esterase) are not available, patients should be treated with drug regimens effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia. Further testing to determine the specific etiology is recommended because both chlamydia and gonorrhea are reportable to health departments and a specific diagnosis might improve partner notification and treatment. Culture, nucleic acid hybridization tests, and NAATs are available for the detection of both <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and <i>C. trachomatis</i>. Culture and hybridization tests require urethral swab specimens, whereas NAATs can be performed on urine specimens. Because of their&nbsp;higher sensitivity, NAATs are preferred for the detection of C. trachomatis (197).</p>

  <p>Etiology</p>

  <p>Several organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The presence of Gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) on urethral smear is indicative of gonorrhea infection, which is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. Nongonoccocal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when examination findings or microscopy indicate inflammation without GNID, is caused by <i>C. trachomatis</i> in 15%–40% of cases; however, prevalence varies by age group, with a lower burden of disease occurring among older men (244). Complications of NGU among males infected with <i>C. trachomatis</i> include epididymitis and Reiter’s syndrome. Documentation of chlamydial infection is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment.</p>

  <p>In most cases of nonchlamydial NGU, no pathogen can be detected. <i>M. genitalium</i>, which appears to be sexually transmitted, is associated with both symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States (240–243). <i>T. vaginalis</i>, HSV, and adenovirus also can cause NGU, but data supporting other <i>Mycoplasma</i> species and <i>Ureaplasma</i> as etiologic agents are inconsistent (244–247). Diagnostic and treatment procedures for these organisms are reserved for situations in which these infections are suspected (e.g., contact with trichomoniasis, genital lesions, or severe dysuria and meatitis, which might suggest genital herpes) or when NGU is not responsive to therapy. Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon cause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal intercourse (244).</p>

  <p>Confirmed Urethritis</p>

  <p>Clinicians should attempt to obtain objective evidence of urethral inflammation. However, if clinic-based diagnostic tools (e.g., Gram-stain microscopy) are not available, patients should be treated with drug regimens effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia.</p>

  <p>Urethritis can be documented on the basis of any of the following signs or laboratory tests:</p>

  <p>• Mucopurulent or purulent discharge on examination.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>• Gram stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥5 WBC per oil immersion field. The Gram stain is the preferred rapid diagnostic test for evaluating urethritis and is highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethritis and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the&nbsp;presence of WBC containing GNID.</p>

  <p>• Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment demonstrating ≥10 WBC per high-power field.</p>

  <p>If none of these criteria are present, testing for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and <i>C. trachomatis</i> using NAATs might identify additional infections (248). If the results demonstrate infection with either of these pathogens, the appropriate treatment should be given and sex partners referred for evaluation and treatment. If none of these criteria are present, empiric treatment of symptomatic males is recommended only for men at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation. Such patients should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia. Partners of patients treated empirically should be evaluated and treated, if indicated.</p>
