  <h2 id="heading_id_2">Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)</h2>

  <p>Granuloma inguinale is a genital ulcerative disease caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium <i>Klebsiella granulomatis</i> (formerly known as <i>Calymmatobacterium granulomatis</i>). The disease occurs rarely in the United States, although it is endemic in some tropical and developing areas, including India; Papua, New Guinea; the Caribbean; central Australia; and southern Africa (192,193). Clinically, the disease is com- monly characterized as painless, slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals or perineum without regional lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous granulomas (pseudoboboes) might also occur. The lesions are highly vascular (i.e., beefy red appearance) and bleed easily on contact. The clinical presentation also can include hypertrophic, necrotic, or sclerotic variants. Extragenital infection can occur with extension of infection to the pelvis, or it can disseminate to intraabdominal organs, bones, or the mouth. The lesions also can develop secondary bacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually transmitted pathogens.</p>

  <p>The causative organism is difficult to culture, and diagnosis requires visualization of dark-staining Donovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy. No FDA-cleared molecular tests for the detection of <i>K. granulomatis</i> DNA exist, but such an assay might be useful when undertaken by laboratories that have conducted a CLIA verification study.</p>

  <p>Treatment</p>

  <p>Several antimicrobial regimens have been effective, but only a limited number of controlled trials have been published (192). Treatment has been shown to halt progression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward from the ulcer margins; prolonged therapy is usually required to permit granulation&nbsp;and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse can occur 6–18 months after apparently effective therapy.</p>

  <p>The addition of an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) to these regimens can be consid- ered if improvement is not evident within the first few days of therapy.</p>

  <p>Follow-Up</p>

  <p>Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved.</p>

  <p>Management of Sex Partners</p>

  <p>Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has granuloma inguinale within the 60 days before onset of the patient’s symptoms should be examined and offered therapy. However, the value of empiric therapy in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms has not been established.</p>

  <p>Special Considerations Pregnancy</p>

  <p>Pregnancy is a relative contraindication to the use of sulfonamides. Pregnant and lactating women should be treated with the erythromycin regimen, and consideration should be given to the addition of a parenteral aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin). Azithromycin might prove useful for treating granuloma inguinale during pregnancy, but published data are lacking. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnant women.</p>

  <p>HIV Infection</p>

  <p>Persons with both granuloma inguinale and HIV infection should receive the same regimens as those who are HIV&nbsp;negative; however, the addition of a parenteral aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin) can also be considered.</p>
